General
-------
The Higgs Gun is my ([Jeasonfire](https://jeasonfire.github.io/)) contribution to the 32nd Ludum Dare, in the compo.

Mechanics
---------
The player has a weapon (_an unconventional weapon_, you could say) called the "Higgs' Gun", a gun that fires particles that change the state of special materials, like changing a transparent non-physical object into a solid, and vice versa. (_the higgs' gun gives things mass_, you could say)
